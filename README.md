- 👋 Hi, I’m @Dcamy, born and raised in Alaska, married and living in Bali

- 👀 I’m interested in a lot different shit but mostly crypto and the lack of plug and play tools for crypto companies

- 🌱 I’m currently learning React JS, Solidity, everything... never did any coding at all until a few weeks ago when I downloaded a React template that looks nice but is
missing a lot of what I want, and much of what is there are deadend links. i.e. News letter Signup puts the data where? No where lol, Signup does what? Nothing.  

- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on Discord Bot builds, TG bot builds, Website builds, IPFS, everything I claim to be able to do here... I'm going to get sorted
