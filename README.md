- 👋 Hi, I’m @Dcamy, born and raised in Alaska, married and living in Thailand with a baby on the way

- 👀 I’m interested in a lot different shit but mostly crypto and the lack of plug and play tools for crypto companies - And now AI

- 🌱 I’m currently learning React JS, Solidity, everything... never did any coding at all until a few weeks ago when I downloaded a React template that looks nice but is
missing a lot of what I want, and much of what is there are deadend links. i.e. News letter Signup puts the data where? No where lol, Signup does what? Nothing.  

- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on my iChain project, it's a new kind of blockchain that uses proof of contribution (PoC) for minting, zero fees on peer to peer transactions and more apps, features and games than I could od my self, maybe even with a team of action agaents. 

The concept behind PoC is that any quantifiable and confirmable action equals a reward. For oour launch we are building a Crypto Crowdfunding platform where the NFT and tokens are your proof of investment and thus your right to an ROI. This compounds over time. For example is Issact Knewton had iChain in his pocket it would have recorded on the chain his discovery of gravity and any project or tech that built on that would result in him getting a reward
